## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

```python 
from precision_metrics import calculate_precision

# Example data
y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

precision = calculate_precision(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
```
## Description

Precision can be calculated as:

Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

Precision provides insight into the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct, making it particularly useful in scenarios where the cost of false positives is high.
