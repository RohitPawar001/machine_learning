# Anomaly Detection using Local Outlier Factor (LOF)


This repository implements anomaly detection using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm. LOF is an unsupervised machine learning method that identifies anomalies by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors.

## Overview

Anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, including fraud detection, system health monitoring, and outlier analysis in datasets. This project utilizes the Local Outlier Factor algorithm, which is particularly effective for detecting anomalies in datasets with varying densities.

Key features:
- Implementation of LOF using scikit-learn
- Visualization of anomalies in 2D and 3D spaces
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning the algorithm
- Example datasets for quick start and testing

## Installation

To use this project, first clone the repository:
Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the LOF anomaly detection:

```python
from lof_detector import LOFDetector
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)
# Add some outliers
X = np.r_[X, [[2, 2], [2, 3], [3, 2]]]

# Initialize and fit the detector
detector = LOFDetector(n_neighbors=20)
detector.fit(X)

# Predict anomalies
anomalies = detector.predict(X)

# Visualize results
detector.visualize(X, anomalies)
```

## How It Works

The Local Outlier Factor algorithm works as follows:

1. For each data point, it calculates the distance to its k-nearest neighbors.
2. It then computes the local density for each point using these distances.
3. The LOF score is determined by comparing the local density of a point to the local densities of its neighbors.
4. Points with substantially lower density than their neighbors are classified as outliers.

The algorithm is particularly useful because it can detect anomalies in datasets where different regions have different densities.
