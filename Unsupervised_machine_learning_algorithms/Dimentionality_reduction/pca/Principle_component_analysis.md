# Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

## Overview

This project implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. PCA is a powerful technique used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while preserving as much statistical information as possible.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd pca-dimensionality-reduction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the PCA implementation:

```python
from pca_reduction import PCA

# Load your data
X = load_data()

# Initialize PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)

# Fit the model and transform the data
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)

# Plot the results
plot_results(X_reduced)
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [documentation](docs/usage.md).

## Features

- Efficient implementation of PCA
- Support for specifying the number of components
- Visualization tools for reduced data
- Compatibility with scikit-learn API

## How It Works

PCA works by identifying the principal components of the data, which are the directions of maximum variance. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Standardize the data
2. Compute the covariance matrix
3. Calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues
4. Sort eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues
5. Choose top k eigenvectors
6. Transform the original data
