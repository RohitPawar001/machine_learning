## Introduction

Dimensionality reduction is a crucial step in many machine learning pipelines, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data. This project aims to provide efficient implementations of popular dimensionality reduction techniques, along with examples and comparisons.

## Techniques Implemented

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
- UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each dimensionality reduction technique is implemented in its own module. You can import and use them as follows:

```python
from dimensionality_reduction import pca, tsne, umap

# Example usage with PCA
reduced_data = pca.reduce_dimensions(data, n_components=2)
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation in each module.

## Examples

You can find example notebooks in the `examples/` directory, demonstrating the usage of each technique on various datasets.
