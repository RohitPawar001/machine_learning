## Introduction

K-means clustering is one of the most popular and simple unsupervised machine learning algorithms. It is used to partition n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centroid).

## Algorithm Overview

The K-means algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize k centroids randomly in the feature space.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all points assigned to that centroid.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer move significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Mathematical Formulation

The objective of K-means is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS):

Where:
- k is the number of clusters
- S_i is the i-th cluster
- x is a point in S_i
- Î¼_i is the mean of points in S_i

## Implementation

Here's a basic implementation of K-means clustering using Python and NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

def kmeans(X, k, max_iters=100):
    # Randomly initialize centroids
    centroids = X[np.random.choice(X.shape[0], k, replace=False)]
    
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        # Assign points to nearest centroid
        distances = np.sqrt(((X - centroids[:, np.newaxis])**2).sum(axis=2))
        labels = np.argmin(distances, axis=0)
        
        # Update centroids
        new_centroids = np.array([X[labels == i].mean(axis=0) for i in range(k)])
        
        # Check for convergence
        if np.all(centroids == new_centroids):
            break
        
        centroids = new_centroids
    
    return labels, centroids

# Example usage
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)  # 100 random points in 2D
k = 3
labels, centroids = kmeans(X, k)
```

## Usage

To use this implementation:

1. Ensure you have NumPy installed: `pip install numpy`
2. Copy the `kmeans` function into your Python script or notebook.
3. Prepare your data as a NumPy array.
4. Call the function with your data and desired number of clusters.

Example:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# Generate sample data
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.60, random_state=0)

# Run K-means
k = 4
labels, centroids = kmeans(X, k)

# Visualize results (requires matplotlib)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], c='red', marker='x', s=200, linewidths=3)
plt.title('K-means Clustering Results')
plt.show()
```

## Advantages and Limitations

Advantages:
- Simple to understand and implement
- Scales well to large datasets
- Guarantees convergence

Limitations:
- Requires specifying the number of clusters (k) in advance
- Sensitive to initial centroid positions
- May converge to local optima
- Assumes spherical clusters of similar size

## Advanced Topics

- K-means++: An improved initialization method
- Mini-batch K-means: A more efficient version for large datasets
- Elbow method: A technique for choosing the optimal k
- Silhouette analysis: A method for evaluating clustering quality
