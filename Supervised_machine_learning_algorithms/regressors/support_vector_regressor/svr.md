## Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a specific implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm designed for regression tasks.

## Overview

SVR is a powerful and flexible supervised learning algorithm that can handle continuous output variables. It aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best fits the data points in the feature space, while maintaining a specified margin of tolerance.
Getting Started

## Installation:

Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (e.g., NumPy, scikit-learn).
Install scikit-learn using pip:
Copypip install scikit-learn



## Usage:

Import SVR from scikit-learn:
```python
from sklearn.svm import SVR
```


## Example:

Load your dataset (e.g., using make_regression from sklearn.datasets).
Create an SVR model:

```python
svr_model = SVR(kernel='rbf', C=100, epsilon=0.1)
svr_model.fit(X, y)  # X: feature matrix, y: target values

```

## Hyperparameters:

kernel: Choose the kernel type (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, etc.).

C: Regularization parameter (controls the trade-off between the flatness of the function and the amount of deviations larger than epsilon).

epsilon: Specifies the epsilon-tube within which no penalty is associated in the training loss function with points predicted within a distance epsilon from the actual value.




## Evaluation:

Evaluate your model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
Visualize predicted vs. actual values.
