## Overview

The Decision Tree Regressor is a tree-based machine learning model used for regression tasks. It works by creating a tree-like structure of decisions based on the input features to predict a continuous target variable.

## Features

- Easy-to-use implementation of Decision Tree Regressor
- Supports both numerical and categorical features
- Customizable hyperparameters for tree depth, minimum samples per leaf, etc.
- Built-in cross-validation and grid search for model tuning
- Visualization tools for tree structure and feature importance

## Installation

To install the Decision Tree Regressor, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install decision-tree-regressor
```

Or clone this repository and install the required dependencies:



## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Decision Tree Regressor:

```python
from decision_tree_regressor import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, noise=0.1)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"R-squared score: {score:.4f}")
```
