# Ensemble Regression Techniques

## Overview

This repository explores various ensemble regression techniques, powerful methods that combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. Ensemble methods are widely used in machine learning and data science to enhance model performance and reduce overfitting.

## Introduction

Ensemble regression techniques leverage the power of multiple models to make more accurate predictions than any single model could achieve alone. These methods are particularly useful when dealing with complex datasets or when you want to reduce the risk of overfitting.

## Techniques Covered

This repository includes implementations and examples of the following ensemble regression techniques:

1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**
   - Random Forests
   - Extra Trees

2. **Boosting**
   - AdaBoost
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost
   - LightGBM

3. **Stacking**

4. **Blending**

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you'll need Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm
```

## Usage

Each ensemble technique is implemented in its own module. You can import and use them as follows:

```python
from ensemble_techniques import RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor

# Create and train a Random Forest model
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
rf_predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Create and train a Gradient Boosting model
gb_model = GradientBoostingRegressor()
gb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
gb_predictions = gb_model.predict(X_test)
```
