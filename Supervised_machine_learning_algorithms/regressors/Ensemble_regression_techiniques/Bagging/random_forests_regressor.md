# Random Forest Regressor

## Overview

This project implements a Random Forest Regressor, a versatile ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. Random Forests combine multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate predictive model. This implementation focuses on regression problems, where the goal is to predict continuous values.

## Installation

To use this Random Forest Regressor, you need Python 3.7 or later. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:



## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the Random Forest Regressor:

```python
from random_forest import RandomForestRegressor

# Create and train the model
rf_regressor = RandomForestRegressor(n_trees=100, max_depth=10)
rf_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = rf_regressor.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = rf_regressor.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [documentation](docs/usage.md).

## How It Works

Random Forest Regressor works by creating multiple decision trees and averaging their outputs to make predictions. The key steps are:

1. **Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)**: Random subsets of the training data are created with replacement.
2. **Feature Randomness**: A random subset of features is selected for each tree.
3. **Decision Tree Creation**: Multiple regression trees are grown using the bagged data and selected features.
4. **Averaging**: For regression, the final prediction is the average of all tree predictions.

This approach helps to reduce overfitting and improves generalization compared to single decision trees.

## Features

- Customizable number of trees in the forest
- Adjustable maximum depth for each tree
- Feature importance calculation
- Support for various regression metrics (MSE, MAE, R-squared)
- Cross-validation support
- Parallel processing for faster training and prediction
- Handling of missing values
