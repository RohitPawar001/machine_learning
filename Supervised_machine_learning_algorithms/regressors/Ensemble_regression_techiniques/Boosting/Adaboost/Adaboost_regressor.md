# AdaBoost Regressor

## Overview

This project implements an AdaBoost Regressor, a powerful ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictor. This implementation focuses on regression problems, where the goal is to predict continuous values with high accuracy.

## Installation

To use this AdaBoost Regressor, you need Python 3.7 or later. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:


## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the AdaBoost Regressor:

```python
from adaboost import AdaBoostRegressor

# Create and train the model
ada_regressor = AdaBoostRegressor(n_estimators=50, learning_rate=1.0)
ada_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = ada_regressor.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = ada_regressor.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [documentation](docs/usage.md).

## How It Works

AdaBoost Regressor works by iteratively improving predictions. The key steps are:

1. **Initialize**: Start with equal weights for all training samples.
2. **Train Weak Learner**: Fit a base regressor (often a decision tree) on the weighted data.
3. **Compute Error**: Calculate the error of the weak learner.
4. **Update Weights**: Increase weights for poorly predicted samples and decrease for well-predicted ones.
5. **Combine Predictors**: The final model is a weighted combination of all weak learners.

This process continues for a specified number of iterations, with each iteration focusing more on the difficult-to-predict samples.

## Features

- Customizable number of estimators (weak learners)
- Adjustable learning rate to control the contribution of each weak learner
- Support for various base estimators (default is usually decision trees)
- Automatic feature selection through the boosting process
- Handling of missing values
- Built-in cross-validation support
- Feature importance calculation
