# Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Overview

Gradient Boosting is a powerful machine learning technique used for both regression and classification problems. This README focuses on the Gradient Boosting Classifier, which is specifically used for classification tasks.

## What is Gradient Boosting?

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a strong predictor. It builds the model in a stage-wise manner, optimizing an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

## How Gradient Boosting Classifier Works

1. **Initialization**: The model starts with a simple prediction (usually the mean of the target variable for regression or log-odds for classification).

2. **Iterative Process**:
   - Calculate the negative gradient (residuals) of the loss function.
   - Fit a weak learner (decision tree) to these residuals.
   - Update the model by adding this weak learner, scaled by a learning rate.
   - Repeat for a specified number of iterations.

3. **Prediction**: Combine the predictions of all weak learners to make the final prediction.

## Advantages

- High predictive accuracy
- Handles non-linear relationships well
- Automatically handles feature interactions
- Can handle mixed data types (numerical and categorical)
- Less prone to overfitting compared to other boosting methods

## Disadvantages

- Can be computationally expensive
- Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters
- Less interpretable than simpler models

## Implementation

Popular libraries for implementing Gradient Boosting Classifiers include:

- Scikit-learn: `GradientBoostingClassifier`
- XGBoost: `XGBClassifier`
- LightGBM: `LGBMClassifier`

## Basic Usage with Scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assuming X is your feature matrix and y is your target vector
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
gbc = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
gbc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = gbc.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

## Hyperparameters

Key hyperparameters to tune include:

- `n_estimators`: Number of boosting stages (trees)
- `learning_rate`: Shrinks the contribution of each tree
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of individual trees
- `min_samples_split`: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node
- `min_samples_leaf`: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node
