# Random Forest Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. Random Forests are a combination of decision trees, typically trained with the "bagging" method. The model in this project focuses on classification tasks.

## Installation

To use this Random Forest Classifier, you need Python 3.7 or later. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:



## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the Random Forest Classifier:

```python
from random_forest import RandomForestClassifier

# Create and train the model
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_trees=100, max_depth=10)
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = rf_classifier.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [documentation](docs/usage.md).

## How It Works

Random Forest Classifier works by creating multiple decision trees and combining their outputs to make predictions. The key steps are:

1. **Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)**: Random subsets of the training data are created with replacement.
2. **Feature Randomness**: A random subset of features is selected for each tree.
3. **Decision Tree Creation**: Multiple decision trees are grown using the bagged data and selected features.
4. **Voting**: For classification, the final prediction is the majority vote of all trees.

This approach helps to reduce overfitting and improves generalization compared to single decision trees.

## Features

- Customizable number of trees in the forest
- Adjustable maximum depth for each tree
- Feature importance calculation
- Support for both binary and multi-class classification
- Cross-validation support
- Parallel processing for faster training and prediction
