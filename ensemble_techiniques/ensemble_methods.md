## Introduction

Ensemble methods are machine learning techniques that combine several base models to produce one optimal predictive model. They are designed to increase the accuracy and robustness of predictions compared to using a single model.

## Ensemble Methods

### Bagging

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) involves training multiple instances of the same algorithm on different subsets of the training data and then aggregating their predictions.



### Boosting

Boosting methods train models sequentially, with each new model focusing on the errors of the previous ones. Common algorithms include AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.



### Random Forests

Random Forests is an extension of bagging that uses decision trees as the base model and incorporates feature randomness in the tree-building process.



### Stacking

Stacking involves training multiple diverse base models and then training a meta-model that learns how to best combine the predictions of the base models.


## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you'll need Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
